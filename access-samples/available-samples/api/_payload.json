APOE4 is estimated to be implicated in more than 50 percent of all cases of older-onset Alzheimer’s, the  most common form of the disease. Though the trial was terminated before completing enrollment, the API Generation Program generated a large, shareable resource of biomaterial including blood based biomarkers, CSF and genomic material. These are available as: 1) cross-sectional aliquots from those who were successfully screened but not randomized to the trial, and 2) longitudinal aliquots from those who were randomized to the trial protocols (in varying stages of protocol completion).
