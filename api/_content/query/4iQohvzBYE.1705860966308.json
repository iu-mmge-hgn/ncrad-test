These foundational years set the stage for what NCRAD would become.\"},{\"dates\":\"2002-2008\",\"title\":\"Evolution and Expansion\",\"description\":\"In 2002, NCRAD took a significant step forward as it transitioned into a U24 (cooperative agreement). It marked the start of a new era with NCRAD supporting its first trans-ADC study and banking DNA from LOAD families recruited by ADCs. Additionally, NCRAD began its collaboration with ADNI, further solidifying its role as a vital resource in Alzheimer's research. \"},{\"dates\":\"2009-2014\",\"title\":\"Expanding Horizons\",\"description\":\"As NCRAD continued to grow, so did its scope. The renewal of NCRAD during this period brought about funding collaboration with the ADGC. Sample types expanded, and NCRAD became the trusted repository for samples from 23 NIA-funded studies. These years saw NCRAD firmly establishing itself as a cornerstone of Alzheimer's research.\"},{\"dates\":\"2015-2020\",\"title\":\"A Period of Unprecedented Collaboration\",\"description\":\"NCRAD's journey reached new heights with its renewal and expanded scope, marked by close collaboration with the ADSP and the receipt of iPSCs and fibroblasts.
