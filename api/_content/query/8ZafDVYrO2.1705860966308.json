Genetic factors contribute to the risk for disease with heritability estimates ranging from 57% to 79%. More than a decade ago, the ε4 variant of APOE was identified and remains the most consistently replicated genetic variant influencing the risk of late onset Alzheimer's disease. A segregation analysis suggests there may be four additional genes influencing the age-at-onset of Alzheimer's disease. In 2007 there were 968 association studies in 398 candidate genes reported, but none replicated consistently. There are many reasons for the lack of consistency, but one important reason for the lack of progress is the insufficient number of well characterized families and patients available to the entire scientific community."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Its goal is to identify and recruit families with two or more siblings with the late-onset form of Alzheimer's disease and a cohort of unrelated, non-demented controls similar in age and ethnic background, and to make the samples, the clinical and genotyping data and preliminary analyses available to qualified investigators world-wide. This genotyping represents the largest collection of families ever assembled with Alzheimer's disease combining the NIA-AD FBS Genetics Initiative Multiplex Family Study, the National Centralized Repository for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (NCRAD) with additional controls from the University of Kentucky.
