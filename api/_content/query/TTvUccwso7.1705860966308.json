Genetic testing may involve an analysis of specific genes (segments of DNA that provide the instructions for a specific protein), chromosomes (the packages of a person’s DNA within the body’s cells), or proteins ( the products of our genes). Most gene tests involve looking for changes in the DNA sequence. That is, they look at the order of the adenines (A), thymines (T), guanines (G), and cytosines (C) that combine to make DNA, which is then packaged in the chromosomes (See Figure 1). Changes in DNA sequence could lead to a non-functional gene or a gene that functions improperly."}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"  "},{"type":"element","tag":"picture","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n    "},{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"src":"/assets/genetics-families/dna_sequence.png","alt":"Figure 1.

They may also help determine how a person may respond to a specific treatment or medication. In general, genetic testing has become a valuable tool in the diagnosis of genetic disorders, the prediction of future disease, and the management of those who are affected or at risk for a condition with a genetic basis.
