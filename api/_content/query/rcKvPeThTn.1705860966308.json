The format of this reconciliation varies by project and study and is determined by the plan developed with the data coordinating center. We currently perform reconciliation monthly with the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center (NACC) for all ADC samples received by NCRAD. We also send monthly lists of received ADC samples to the site coordinators for confirmation. A similar approach is used for other studies. Sample reconciliation is not limited to the presence or absence of samples and data, but also includes the number of aliquots of each specimen type and protocol adherence. If any discrepancies are identified at sample log-in, the site where the sample was collected is immediately contacted. Once any discrepancies are clarified, the NCRAD coordinator logs the nonconformance into our database."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"heading","props":{"className":["rvt-ts-md"],"level":"2","text":"Procedure Manual Development"},"children":[]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"NCRAD has developed a study specific manual of procedures for new studies banking with NCRAD.

The NCRAD catalogs then provide the link to the public databases containing genetic and genomic data generated from samples from these subjects."}]}]}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:bank-samples:sample-management:index.md","_source":"content","_file":"bank-samples/sample-management/index.md","_extension":"md"}
