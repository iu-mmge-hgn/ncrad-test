The National Centralized Repository for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (NCRAD) often collaborates very closely with research studies and institutions around the world. Through these collaborations, we have compiled a listing of different studies that are currently enrolling subjects and banking samples with NCRAD. We have separated these studies into three categories: “For Those with Dementia”, “For Those with Dementia in Your Family”, and “For Healthy Individuals Who Want to Help”. Please feel free to explore each study by clicking on the study logo. Once clicked, a window will appear offering important information about each study. Information includes location of research sites and how to contact the study coordinator. If you have any additional questions about this webpage, NCRAD Coordinators would be happy to assist. Please call 1-800-526-2839 or email alzstudy@iu.edu to talk with a NCRAD coordinator."}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"heading","props":{"className":["rvt-ts-md"],"level":"2","text":"For Those with Dementia"},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"  "},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The below studies are specifically enrolling families heavily burdened by dementia and/or Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
