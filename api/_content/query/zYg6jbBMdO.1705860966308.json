In addition, they use immunohistochemistry (IHC), a method that stains with antibodies to identify specific proteins or protein modifications in rain.

It is important to recognize that, once Aβ has been deposited, it is considered that the disease process has begun but that this happens many years in advance of changes in memory or thinking. As the subscores for A, B and C rise (from 0 to 3), it becomes more likely that ADNC are responsible for dementia. Since other diseases might be presented as well (such as changes in the blood vessels or other forms of neurodegenerative disease), some patients will be impaired with lower ABC scores that might be expected. There will be others who, despite having high ABC scores, remain intact without changes in memory or other functions – this is a pattern known as ‘resilience’ and trying to understand it is an important area of research currently."}]}]}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:importance-of-autopsy:autopsy-reports.md","_source":"content","_file":"importance-of-autopsy/autopsy-reports.md","_extension":"md"}
