The buffy coat is the thin layer (.5 - .75mL) between the plasma and red blood cells. There should always be a buffy coat and it is usually white in color.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The buffy coat should be extracted from the lavender-top EDTA tubes and extraction should occur after the plasma has been transferred. Using sterile gloves and a sterile pipette, extract the buffy coat from one of the lavender-top EDTA tubes by going in a circular motion around the inside of the tube where the buffy coat is and aliquot it into one of the 2mL cryogenic vials. Repeat this process for the second lavender-top EDTA tube and the remaining, empty 2mL cryogenic vial. It is very normal to get some of the red blood cells when extracting the buffy coat and if red blood cells are not included then you have not gone far enough down the tube. Since some red blood cells will be included, then you will likely get 1 ml or more volume transferred to the cryovial. Be sure to complete all fields on the labels and secure each label to a cryogenic vial without obscuring any information.\u003C/p>\n",{"title":23,"content":24,"actions":25},"Study Related Video Tutorials","\u003Cp>Please explore the below videos sponsored by NCRAD for the PSDC study.\u003C/p>\n",[26,30,33],{"text":27,"url":28,"type":7,"external":29},"Ambient Shipping","https://www.youtube.com/embed/F3i0zo65ZzM",true,{"text":31,"url":32,"type":7,"external":29},"Frozen Shipping","https://www.youtube.com/embed/s28ZP2A-V5s",{"text":34,"url":35,"type":7,"external":29},"RNA PAXgene Processing","https://www.youtube.com/embed/GGXOdilI8ww",{"type":37,"children":38,"toc":39},"root",[],{"title":7,"searchDepth":40,"depth":40,"links":41},2,[],"markdown","content:coordinate-studies:adni-dod.md","content","coordinate-studies/adni-dod.md","md",1705861108490]
