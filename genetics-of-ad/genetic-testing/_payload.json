Most gene tests involve looking for changes in the DNA sequence. That is, they look at the order of the adenines (A), thymines (T), guanines (G), and cytosines (C) that combine to make DNA, which is then packaged in the chromosomes (See Figure 1).

They may also help determine how a person may respond to a specific treatment or medication. In general, genetic testing has become a valuable tool in the diagnosis of genetic disorders, the prediction of future disease, and the management of those who are affected or at risk for a condition with a genetic basis.
